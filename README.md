# Null Safety and Exception Handling Program
Write a Dart program that asks users to input their age. Implement the following:
Use null safety features to ensure that the program doesnâ€™t crash if the user enters an invalid age or nothing at all.
If the user enters a valid age, print a message that tells them how many years are left until they turn 100.
Handle exceptions when converting the input to an integer, and show a user-friendly error message if something goes wrong.
